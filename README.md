# Coding in C/C++ Examples

This is a bunch of coding examples from teaching my brother to code.

## Useful Git Commands

##### Uploading a file to the Repo

To add myFile.cpp to github use the following

```
git add myFile.cpp

git commit -m "Write what changes you made here"

git push

```

##### Updating the files on your computer

Type this into the git bash terminal.

```
git pull
```

## Compiling and Running C/C++ code

To compile myFile.cpp with g++ type:

```
g++ myFile.cpp -o myFile.exe
```

Or if you are compiling c code:

```
gcc myFile.c -o myFile.exe
```

To run the code on a terminal:

```
./myFile.exe
```
Or if you are using Window's command prompt just type:

```
myFile.exe
```
